The solution is to always use strict comparison (`===`) when comparing values in PHP to avoid type juggling issues:

```php
$value = 0;
if ($value === '0') {
  echo 'Values are strictly equal'; // This will NOT execute
} else {
  echo 'Values are NOT strictly equal'; // This will execute
}

$value = 0;
if ($value === 0) {
  echo 'Values are strictly equal'; // This will execute
}
```

Using strict comparison ensures that both the value and the type are compared, preventing unintended consequences from PHP's loose comparison rules.
